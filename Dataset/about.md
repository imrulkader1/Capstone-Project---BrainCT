# About Dataset

**Computed Tomography (CT)** of the Brain
The dataset consists of **CT brain** scans with **cancer, tumor, and aneurysm**. Each scan represents a detailed image of a patient's brain taken using **CT (Computed Tomography)**. The data are presented in 2 different formats: **.jpg** and **.dcm**.

The **dataset** of **CT brain** scans is valuable for research in neurology, radiology, and oncology. It allows the development and evaluation of computer-based algorithms, machine learning models, and deep learning techniques for automated detection, diagnosis, and classification of these conditions.
